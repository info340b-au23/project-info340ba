            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Within the UW, there are currently 180+ different <a target="_blank" href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/">majors</a>. Unfortunately, within that is a large subset of competitive majors which employ a selective-admissions process. STEM majors and computing majors are particularly affected. For instance, Informatics (Information Technology) admitted just 210 students out of an applicant pool of 610 students (36.02%) this past Spring Cycle. For incoming freshman, making the most of these competitive processes includes a lengthy process of research, competitive classes, and often multiple applications. Although tools and resources exist, they come largely from word of mouth and sparse pieces of information released infrequently by admissions staff within these different colleges. To move past the elusiveness of shared application essays and often informal advice given through the form of online platforms, there needs to be a new resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                By categorizing and displaying important <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhEMxCvpOxVgOQexD1vk01b9QRYK_cPAQD1rEZqwCvY/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> from upperclassmen who persevere through the process, we can make the advice and resources they used public information and create an accessible public tool to better prepare applicants. Oftentimes, applicant success moves beyond good grades and into extracurriculars and passion projects - all of which we can display and survey through a new platform.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>We believe that the main users of our app would be the students or anyone particularly interesting in the STEM field and the end result for some of their upperclassmens journeys through it. Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhEMxCvpOxVgOQexD1vk01b9QRYK_cPAQD1rEZqwCvY/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> gathered from upperclassmen (by survey or user input), we will display a list of each persons university they attended, their salary, current occupation, and any resources that helped them get to where they are. Minority groups are especially benefitted because the resources presented on the app would help them with any application and/or financial needs. Our app will push forward a more efficient way to finding advice and resources. By organizing the outcomes of peoples paths, students can get a clearer picture of where they want to be at the end of their path.

                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <p>
                    Through Pathwise, users would have the option to add their own path to enlargen the size of our data pool. Presenting a survey-type page, it would let the user input their information so that future users may benefit from it. Upon completing their entry, the page would be updating with their information, adding to the list and changing any charts or diagrams. Our next feature would allow the user to filter or reorganize the page to their needs. The user could filter the page to only see people who had graduated the university of washington, they would also have the option to change the listing to show greatest to least, and vice versa, in terms of salary. The default listing would display the most recent data entry. Our final feature would allow the user to favorite/bookmark a specific persons data entry. This list of favorited entries would appear on a separate page via the navigation bar.
