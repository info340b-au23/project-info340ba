            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Within the UW, there are currently 180+ different <a target="_blank" href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/">majors</a>. Unfortunately, within that is a large subset of competitive majors which employ a selective-admissions process. STEM majors and computing majors are particularly affected. For instance, Informatics (Information Technology) admitted just 210 students out of an applicant pool of 610 students (36.02%) this past Spring Cycle. For incoming freshman, making the most of these competitive processes includes a lengthy process of research, competitive classes, and often multiple applications. Although tools and resources exist, they come largely from word of mouth and sparse pieces of information released infrequently by admissions staff within these different colleges. To move past the elusiveness of shared application essays and often informal advice given through the form of online platforms, there needs to be a new resource.

                By categorizing and displaying important <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhEMxCvpOxVgOQexD1vk01b9QRYK_cPAQD1rEZqwCvY/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> from upperclassmen who persevere through the process, we can make the advice and resources they used public information and create an accessible public tool to better prepare applicants. Oftentimes, applicant success moves beyond good grades and into extracurriculars and passion projects - all of which we can display and survey through a new platform.
