            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Within the UW, there are currently 180+ different <a target="_blank" href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/">majors</a>. Unfortunately, within that is a large subset of competitive majors which employ a selective-admissions process. STEM majors and computing majors are heavily affected by this. For instance, Informatics (Information Technology) admitted just 210 students out of an applicant pool of 610 students (36.02%) this past Spring Cycle. For incoming freshmen, making the most of these competitive processes includes a lengthy process of research, competitive classes, and often multiple applications. This can be overwhelming and stressful for new students trying to adapt and create a plan for their time at the University of Washington.  Although tools and resources exist, they come largely from word of mouth and sparse pieces of information released infrequently by admissions staff within these different colleges. In order to better prepare students for this arduous process, there needs to exist a better and more centralized resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                By collecting <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhEMxCvpOxVgOQexD1vk01b9QRYK_cPAQD1rEZqwCvY/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> from upperclassmen who make it through the application process, we can publish advice and numerical statistics whilst creating an accessible data-based tool to better prepare new students. Moreover, applicant success involved more than just good grades-with a heavy emphasis on extracuricular activities and experiences. All of these factors that we can track and display through an interactive platform would help underclassmen make informed decisions about their plan, major, and preparation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the University of Washington already has some resources in place to help address this issue for incoming and current students. Some of these tools include <a target="_blank" href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/academic-planning/myplan-academic-planner/">myPlan,</a> the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washington.edu/students/reg/dars/">Degree Audit System (DARS),</a> A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washington.edu/newhuskies/campus-directory/">Campus Resource Guide,</a> and a general <a target="_blank" href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/">Choosing a Major</a> page for students. Despite their availability, these resources lack the depth and perspective to inform students about how best to tailor their applications and extracuriculars. In that regard, student collected data that is displayed in real-time would prove useful, by providing context and major-specific information over time.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>We believe that the main users of our app would be the students of the STEM field as well as students within any other competitive major paths. Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhEMxCvpOxVgOQexD1vk01b9QRYK_cPAQD1rEZqwCvY/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> gathered from upperclassmen (by survey or user input), we will display a list for each person of their university attended, salary, current occupation, and any other relevant resources. Minority groups are especially benefitted because the resources presented on the app would help them with any application and/or financial needs. Our app will create a more efficient way to find advice and resources. By organizing the outcomes of individual paths, students can get a clearer picture of their academic plan.

                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <p>
                    Through Pathwise, users would have the option to add their own path to enlargen the size of our data pool. Presenting a survey-type page, it would let the user input their information so that future users may benefit from it. Upon completing their entry, the page would be updating with their information, adding to the list and changing any charts or diagrams. Our next feature would allow the user to filter or reorganize the page to their needs. The user could filter the page to only see people who had graduated the university of washington, they would also have the option to change the listing to show greatest to least, and vice versa, in terms of salary. The default listing would display the most recent data entry. Our final feature would allow the user to favorite/bookmark a specific persons data entry. This list of favorited entries would appear on a separate page via the navigation bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major feature we plan to implement would be a mentorship matching program. This can provide an opportunity for upperclassmen to add to their resume as well as a valuable resource to younger students. This will encourage upperclassmen to participate and want to share their personal information within this platform. The program would also be very beneficial to the younger students, who will gain first-hand information about a major and degree paths within the University. Furthermore, younger students can use this first-hand perspective to help further shape their decisions regarding major paths and future academic plans.
